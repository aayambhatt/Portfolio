        I aspire to become a good software engineer. I have programmed in JavaScript and worked with C++ to implement data structures, algorithms, and object-oriented programming (OOP), I have knowledge of SQL and MongoDB for database management. I'm passionate about software engineering and have explored RESTful API development using Node.js and Express.js. 
        <br></br>
        My goal is to continuously expand my technical knowledge, bridging theoretical understanding with practical implementation.
